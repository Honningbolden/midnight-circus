# Midnight Circus
This game was created for the VGDA Spring 2025 Game Jam @ CSU Long Beach. It won awards for Best Audio and Officer's Choice at the launch party.
Project is still active as a work in progress.

## Story
You are a young guy, working in the backstage area of everyone's favorite regional circus––the only source of light for a working class in a dystopian world, where the luxuries of technology are reserved for the high-class.
You've accidentally locked yourself inside an equipment room backstage, but you have the chance to escape when the circus' outdated steam-powered power-system overloads–causing an explosion in the room next door allowing you to find an exit.
Finding an exit is not as easy as it seems–there's only the main gate in the carnival area outside, but all doors inside the circus are locked and reinforced––a decision by the ringmaster to prevent thievery from the staff who often seems to the night due to exhaustion.

## Team Spirit & Work Ethic
During the game jam (3 months) we worked in weekly sprints–performing weekly checkins for the team to reconnect and share feedback with each other. This weekly ritual allowed us to be highly adaptable throughout the entire process, while benefitting cross-collaboration and team spitit.
Since this is a voluntary project we aim to have all team members work with what they're most motivated to learn, which makes everyone very driven!
